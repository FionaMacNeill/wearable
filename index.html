She received her BA(hons) Fine Art from University of Kent in 2005, moving into creative digital media and then computing in 2009. MacNeill’s professional practice is founded on user-focused, design-grounded theory, coupled with consideration of privacy and trust issues, particularly in IoT, mobile and cloud computing.</p></div>
