                operation. The journey of our patient is used to explore how a wearable device could be introduced to

            <p class="tl_desc bk">Carol is 58 years old, with a well-established career as a property manager and a
                portfolio of properties across Sussex and Surrey. Her job is important to her and she travels to
                properties two days a week by car in addition to her normal daily commute. Carol is an enthusiastic
                runner and has completed several marathons.

            <h2 class="tl_title">Referral to specialist</h2>
            <p class="tl_desc bk">8 months ago, Carol started to experience pain and discomfort in her left hip while
                running and reported this to her doctor. She attended sports physiotherapy sessions and tried swimming
                as an alternative to running, but found that the pain increased and the movement in her hip became
                restricted. Her doctor referred her to a hip replacement specialist.

            <p class="tl_desc bk">
                Once Carol's appointment with the specialist is confirmed, she is invited for a follow-up with a nurse
                at her doctors surgery. The nurse provides an overview of Carol's care plan including the prescription
                of a wearable device for monitoring heart rate, breathing and electrodermal activity for use from the
                appointment through until the conclusion of recovery.

            <p class="tl_desc bk">
                Carol is examined by the consultant for the hip replacement. She also meets her perioperative nurse,
                Brian who will monitor her vitals and anxiety levels through the wearable system. Brian asks how Carol
                is getting on with the wearable device, has she tried the app yet? Carol and Brian agree on her
                preferred method of contact as part of her pre-operative care plan.

            <p class="tl_desc bk">
                Brian asks Carol to complete the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory<sup>1</sup>. Carol is
                concerned about the operation and how recovery might affect her work and independence.
                Brian notes that the wearable system has shown that Carol's anxiety has increased. Brian talks through
                the operative procedure with her and they agree that he will contact if her anxiety levels continue
                to rise.

            <p class="tl_desc bk">
                Carol receives a letter informing her of the date for her operation; this is both reassuring and
                worrying. She feels underprepared for the operation and recovery. Brian notices a spike in
                her vitals and as previously agreed, sends a text message to check-in with her. After a follow-up call
                with Brian explaining things to arrange for her hospital visit and after care, she feels a lot better.

            <p class="tl_desc bk">
                Due to unforeseen circumstances at the hospital Carol's operation has to be cancelled and rescheduled.
                Unfortunately, the new date occurs when Carol will be abroad and the only other date is several months
                away. Carol is concerned about the level of pain that she will experience during the longer
                wait. The specialist and Brian consider pain management for the waiting period.

            <p class="tl_desc bk">
                Carol feels ready for her operation, although a fire drill at the flats next door the night
                before causes her additional anxiety. Brian is concerned about Carol's levels and decides to move her
                operation to be first in the day. This will minimise her waiting time and to allow her daughter to pick
                her up and take her home as soon as she is cleared to leave.

            <p class="tl_desc bk">
                Carol's daughter took time off work to support Carol's recovery and Brian continued to monitor her
                vitals, contacting her when needed. Initially, Carol was starting to move around too soon, but she could
                tell from the wearable app that this was contributing to increased heart and breathing rates.
                As a result, she took more time to recover and feels positive about care that she received.

                    <p><strong>Fiona MacNeill</strong> is a part-time MSc User Experience
                    Design student and a learning technologist. Her research focuses on the variance between users’
                    perceptual experience of technology and the operational nature of its use; studying the idiomatic
                    culture used to coalesce these two states. She received her BA(hons) Fine Art from University of
                    Kent in 2005, moving into creative digital media and then computing in 2009.
                    MacNeill’s professional practice is founded on user-focused, design-grounded theory, coupled with
                    consideration of privacy and trust issues, particularly in IoT, mobile and cloud computing. She has
                    published work on design theory and mobile learning and has undertaken research and presented in the
                        United States and Europe. In 2016, MacNeill was the recipient of a "highly commended" award
                        in the ALT Learning Technologist of the year awards.

            <p>
                In 2016, Ofcom reported that 71% of UK adults owned a smartphone [#]. This can be viewed alongside smart
                watch ownership, which based on Ofcom's sample, are owned by 5% of UK adults [#]. When we look
                at these statistics in relation to our patient story above, the demographics do not quite match-up.
                Our patient is 58 years old and according to Ofcom the highest proportion of Smartphone owners are
                those under 55. This is intentional as our story is designed to pose a question, what about this adult
                population of under 55s in future years? How will their expectations have been shaped by their use of
                these technologies and the mobile applications they use to manage many services as part of their
                lifestyle? According to the same Ofcom report 44% of adults claimed to use the Internet for looking up
                health information. The interest is patently there and with both wearables and mobile health application
                (or mHealth) forecast to increase [#] it is a trend which cannot afford to be ignored.
                <br /><br />

                As perioperative care is pertinent to any age group, how will these digital expectations be met in
                relation to the perioperative environment specifically? Temporarily setting aside IT infrastructure
                limitations [#], the more specific question is how <em>can</em> these digital expectations be met and
                actioned considering current staff workloads and workflow? This is one facet of what we hope to learn
                through this user-focused research. In the first instance our <em>users</em> shall be health
                professionals, asked to consider the effects both positive and negative of introducing a wearable device
                into a care plan. This exploration will undoubtedly raise more questions than it solves, but these are
                the questions which prepare us for the future.
