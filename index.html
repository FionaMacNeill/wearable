        <div class="col col-8 bios"><p><strong>Fiona MacNeill</strong> is a part-time MSc User Experience Design student, focusing on the variance between users’ perceptual experience of technology and the operational nature of its use; studying the idiomatic culture used to coalesce these two states. She received her BA(hons) Fine Art from University of Kent in 2005, moving into creative digital media and then computing in 2009. MacNeill’s professional practice is founded on user-focused, design-grounded theory, coupled with consideration of privacy and trust issues, particularly in IoT, mobile and cloud computing.</p></div>
