                portfolio of properties across Sussex and Surrey. Her job is important to her and she travels to
                properties two days a week by car in addition to her normal daily commute. Carol is an enthusiastic

            <p class="tl_desc bk">8 months ago, Carol started to experience pain and discomfort in her left hip while
                running and reported this to her doctor. She attended sports physiotherapy sessions and tried swimming
                as an alternative to running, but found that the pain increased and the movement in her hip became
                restricted. Her doctor referred her to a hip replacement specialist.

                Once Carol's appointment with the specialist is confirmed, she is invited for a follow-up with a nurse
                at her doctors surgery. The nurse provides an overview of Carol's care plan including the prescription
                of a wearable device for monitoring heart rate, breathing and electrodermal activity for use from the
                appointment through until the conclusion of recovery.

                Carol is examined by the consultant for the hip replacement. She also meets her perioperative nurse,
                Brian who will monitor her vitals and anxiety levels through the wearable system. Brian asks how Carol
                is getting on with the wearable device, has she tried the app yet? Carol and Brian agree on her
                preferred method of contact as part of her pre-operative care plan.

                Carol is concerned about the operation and how recovery might affect her work and independence.
                Brian notes that the wearable system has shown that Carol's anxiety has increased. Brian talks through
                the operative procedure with her and they agree that he will contact if her anxiety levels continue

                Carol receives a letter informing her of the date for her operation; this is both reassuring and
                worrying. She feels underprepared for the operation and recovery. Brian notices a spike in
                her vitals and as previously agreed, sends a text message to check-in with her. After a follow-up call
                with Brian explaining things to arrange for her hospital visit and after care, she feels a lot better.

                Due to unforeseen circumstances at the hospital Carol's operation has to be cancelled and rescheduled.
                Unfortunately, the new date occurs when Carol will be abroad and the only other date is several months
                away. Carol is concerned about the level of pain that she will experience during the longer
                wait. The specialist and Brian consider pain management for the waiting period.

                Carol feels ready for her operation, although a fire drill at the flats next door the night
                before causes her additional anxiety. Brian is concerned about Carol's levels and decides to move her
                operation to be first in the day. This will minimise her waiting time and to allow her daughter to pick
                her up and take her home as soon as she is cleared to leave.

                Carol's daughter took time off work to support Carol's recovery and Brian continued to monitor her
                vitals, contacting her when needed. Initially, Carol was starting to move around too soon, but she could
                tell from the wearable app that this was contributing to increased heart and breathing rates.
                As a result, she took more time to recover and feels positive about care that she received.

    <h2 title="About site">About</h2>
    <p>This site outlines a future service design and user experience project to be undertaken by F. MacNeill.
        The project is based on, and will contribute to, the ongoing research of Dr. Theo Fotis into the use of wearable
        devices and other technologies in the perioperative environment.

    </div>

    <p>In 2016, Ofcom reported that 71% of UK adults owned a smartphone<a data-scroll href="#2" class="caption-link"><sup>2</sup></a>.
        This can be viewed alongside smart watch ownership,
        which based on Ofcom's sample, are owned by 5% of UK adults<a data-scroll href="#3" class="caption-link"><sup>3</sup></a>.
        When we look at these statistics in relation to our patient story above, the demographics do not quite match-up.
        Our patient is 58 years old and according to Ofcom the highest proportion of Smartphone owners are
        those under 55.
        This is intentional as our story is designed to pose a question, what will this adult
        population of under 55s need and expect in future years? <p class="callout" id="question"><em>How will their
        experiences have been shaped by their use of these technologies and the mobile applications they use to manage
        many essential services as part of their lifestyle, such as banking and work?</em>
    </p>
        <p>
        The rationale for this investigation into the use of a wearable devices to support pre-operative, also termed as perioperative, care is
        specifically is supported by the following drivers:
        </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Perioperative anxiety is experienced by a high proportion of patients [#ref; #ref; #ref].</li>
            <li>Perioperative anxiety can pose serious risks, such as causing the patient to need more anaesthetic,
                which holds it own risks. It can also result in greater post-operative pain for the patients, lengthening
                recovery and may increase the need for pain management medication. Furthermore, anxiety can contribute
                to a weakened immune system and therefore lead to a greater incidence of infection (#ref Bailey, 2010).</li>
            <li>Patients spend less time in hospital, both in terms of the pre-operative period and upon discharge for
                recovery. This means that nurse to patient contact time is reduced making it harder to monitor the
                patient's anxiety and overall physical health; a wearable could help to support an active remote
                dialogue between patient and nurse and support diagnosis.</li>
            <li>As a use case, this application of a wearable device offers clear benefits and a tangible path for
                investigation.</li>
            </ul>

                <p class="goal-text"><strong>To find out</strong> if a consumer-level wearable device could be used as
                    part of a perioperative care plan. The device and an accompanying service would be used to monitor a
                    patient's vital signs, as a means to identify symptoms of anxiety from the pre-operative phase
                    through to recovery.
                    What issues might be raised through the introduction of this disruptive technology? What problems
                    could be solved? If this technology is introduced is there potential for improvement to service and

                <p class="goal-text"><strong>To conceive</strong> how a hypothetical wearable device could be used as
                    part of a patient care plan during the lead up to an operative procedure. In the first instance we
                    strive to understand the perspective of nurses; do they believe that consumer-level wearable devices
                    have potential to be used and what are their reservations? Through user-focused co-design with nurses
                    and other medical professionals we hope to define base requirements for such a system from the care
                    provider's perspective.

        <p>With the adoption of both wearable devices and mobile health applications forecast to increase<a data-scroll href="#10" class="caption-link"><sup>10</sup></a>,
            in spite of the significant technical challenges these disruptive technologies present, these trends cannot

                As a means to explore future service models we acknowledge, yet temporarily set aside IT infrastructure
                limitations[#] as any data/information derived from wearable devices would ideally contribute to a
                patient electronic records system which may not yet be available.
                There is however precedent for independent developers to build applications and services which can
                have interoperability with existing systems where they are available, for example the
                <a href="https://www.echo.co.uk/company" title="echo company site link">echo app</a> for repeat
                prescriptions and medication management, at the primary care level.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project focuses on two possible use case scenarios for wearable devices as diagnostic
                and monitoring tools in a perioperative situation:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Supplied:</strong> a wearable device supplied by the hospital, which is worn for the
                    duration of care from the
                    initiation of care plan, prior to the operation through to recovery. This requires that the patient
                    owns a smartphone, tablet or laptop as at this time consumer-level wearables typically have to
                    synchronise
                    via Bluetooth and cannot operate independently.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>BYOD:</strong> A Bring Your Own Device (B.Y.O.D.) approach, which could be facilitated through a
                    bridging mobile
                    application on the patients' smartphone that would allow the information from a variety of devices
                    to be ported to a compatible format. This requires that the patient owns a compatible wearable
                    device
                    and a smartphone or tablet.
                </li>

                In order to consider how consumer-level wearables could be implemented we need to look at what is
                currently
                available. Specifically, we need to examine the following factors: device form (how it is worn);
                sensors contained; the type of information that can be captured by the sensors; data/information output;
                service restrictions; interoperability; usability; price. These factors will be explored in more depth
                in
                the project a brief summary is provided below.
            </p>

        </div>
    <div class="single-row">
        <div class="col col-4 free-columns device-block">
            <h3>Device form: Hand/Wrist Type</h3>
            <p class="device-desc">Devices worn on the hand or wrist. Devices worn on the wrist typically make contact
                with the inside of the wrist in order to take sensor readings. Some of these devices look similar to digital
                watches and others are more like pieces of jewellery, so there is an aesthetic aspect
                with wearables which must be considered. Devices akin to rings also fall into this category.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Specific examples, currently available:</strong>
                <br>Apple Watch; Fitbit's Charge HR and Surge; Android Wear watches; Samsung Gear S2; Jawbone UP3;
                WellBe; Embrace Watch; Moodmetric Ring; Garmin Vivoactive.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Sensors:</strong>
                <br>Sensors of interest to the project are listed here. Sensors contained vary by device.<br>
                General - Heart rate sensor; accelerometer; gyroscope; ambient light sensor<br>
                Mood-specific devices - peripheral temperature sensor; electro dermal activity sensor.
                Analytical features of some devices: activity, sleep and stress tracking.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Service restrictions:</strong>
                <br>All of the devices above rely on a companion mobile application and/or web application linked
                to an account. These applications provide a visual interface for the device user and link to server/cloud-based
                database storage linked to the user's account. The synchronisation process generally happens via Bluetooth
                between the wearable device and the user's smartphone or tablet. In some cases the devices can be
                physically connected to the computer via USB adaptor.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Interoperability:</strong>
                <br>This cannot be fully determined until a technical assessment of the devices has been undertaken. The
                key considerations are whether the user is able to obtain a download of all of their data and whether the
                device manufacturers provide options for independent developers to create apps which use data from the
                devices. Several of the devices listed above provide tools for developers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Price:</strong>
                Basic models ranging from £80 - £400<br><br>
                <strong>Pros:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Readily visible to the user at all times</li>
                <li>Popular device types are available</li>
                <li>Where the device has an touchscreen interface or physical buttons this could be used for
                    self-reporting of anxiety
                </li>
                <li>Versatility: wristband straps are often interchangeable and some devices can be worn as a clips</li>
                <li>The wearable devices's form/design is most clearly understood. The analogue or historical equivalent
                    of a wrist/hand-based wearable is the watch and as this is clearly understood as a measurement device,
                    it may be easier to acclimatise users to its use.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="device-desc"><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The patient may not wish for others to know about their use of the device</li>
                <li>The device may not be in-keeping with the user's aesthetic taste</li>
                <li>The device may be inconvenient when undertaking certain physical activities</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col col-4 free-columns device-block">
            <h3>Clip-on/Fasten Type</h3>
            <p class="device-desc">Devices clipped or fastened onto clothing, in some bases touching the skin (e.g. inside trouser waistband).
                Another variation which loosely falls into this category are necklaces and pin-badge style wearables.
                Some of the wrist type devices have adaptors to allow them to be worn as clips.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Specific examples, currently available:</strong>
                <br>Spire, Leaf Nature and Urban, Misfit Shine (could be listed in either category due to its versatility
                as a watch or a clip). Withings Pulse Ox can also be worn as a watch or a clip.
                <br>
                <p>
                <strong>Sensors:</strong>
                <br>Sensors of interest to the project are listed here. Sensors contained vary by device.<br>
                Breathing pattern monitor; heart rate monitor; accelerometer; gyroscope; blood-oxygen level.
                Analytical features of some devices: activity, sleep and stress tracking.
                <p>
                <strong>Service restrictions:</strong>
                <br>Like the wrist-based wearables these devices also rely on a companion mobile application and/or web
                application. This is particularly important for these devices as they may have basic watch-type interfaces
                like or a very abstract interface based on small LED lights (such as the Misfit Shine). Furthermore
                some of these devices have slightly unusual forms, for example the Spire resembles a small and smooth
                stone with a robust, yet flexible metal clip on it. This stone has a sort of cork bed that it sits on as
                for synchronisation and charging. The design reflects the calming and meditative emphasis of the device.
                The Leaf Urban looks like a designer necklace and can also be worn as a clip or on a bracelet.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Interoperability:</strong>
                <br>This cannot be fully determined until a technical assessment of the devices has been undertaken.
                    The key considerations are whether the user is able to obtain a download of all of their data and
                    whether the device manufacturers provide options for independent developers to create apps which use
                    data from the devices. Fewer of this device-type category seem to offer this and the emphasis is
                    more on proprietary purpose and software.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Price:</strong> Basic models ranging from £80-£115
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Pros:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>More discreet and can be hidden under clothing</li>
                <li>Perceived as less of a sport or fitness device</li>
                <li>Where the device has an touchscreen interface or physical buttons this could be used for
                    self-reporting
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="device-desc"><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The user may forget to wear/clip on the device</li>
                <li>The device may not be as accurate as it may be further from the user's pulse than devices worn on
                    the wrist
                </li>
                <li>The users phone would need to be the main interface, if an interface for the patient is a
                    requirement
                </li>
                <li>The device may be inconvenient when undertaking certain physical activities</li>
